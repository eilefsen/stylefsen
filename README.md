## Thanks

A lot of the code comes from [Masellum/hugo-theme-nostyleplease](https://github.com/Masellum/hugo-theme-nostyleplease), this could be considered a fork of that repo, although quite a bit modified.

Some of the test pages are from [this jekyll theme](https://github.com/huangyz0918/moving).
